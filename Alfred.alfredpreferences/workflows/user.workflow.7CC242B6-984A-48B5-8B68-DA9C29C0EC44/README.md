# Giphy.alfredworkflow

A workflow for [Alfred][alfred] that searches [Giphy][giphy] for animated gifs.
Actioning on a search item will preview the gif using Quick Look and copy the
direct URL of the gif to the clipboard.

## TODO

- Get a production Giphy API key?
- Copy the link to the Giphy page (instead of the gif) with a keyboard
  modifier.
- Figure out how to use the mp4 for Quick Look instead of the gif.
